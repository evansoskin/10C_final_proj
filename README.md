# 10C_final_proj
Thi sis my Qt project created for the final project assignment for UCLA Pic 10C fall 2016.

About the game:
The game is a simple game where you move a green dot with the arrow keys to collect black dots.
You get 100 points for collecting a black dot, and lose 1 point for each movement.
The goal is to maximize your score, which means minimizing the number of moves needed to collect all the dots.

About the code:
I created a working game then added a main menu to run the game.

About improvements:
I created this without an exact idea on what else I wanted to add.
This meant any new idea I had, had to be implemented based on existing code.
If I were to redo this project, some things might look nicer knowing full functionality from the beginning.
